#### Cost Optimization Strategies for Storage Constraints

##### Storage-Constrained Optimization
- **Log Aggregation**: Combine multiple log entries into single records
- **Compression**: Use gzip/lz4 compression for log storage
- **Sampling**: Sample logs at 10-20% rate for high-volume services
- **Retention Tiers**: Keep detailed logs for 7 days, aggregated for 90 days

##### Loki Stack Optimization (Recommended for <5GB)
- **Log Aggregation**: Combine similar log entries
- **Compression**: Enable gzip compression (70-80% reduction)
- **Label Optimization**: Limit labels to essential fields only
- **Chunk Storage**: Use efficient object storage with compression

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# loki-config.yaml
compression:
  enabled: true
  algorithm: gzip

storage_config:
  aws:
    s3: s3://bucket/loki
    region: us-west-2
    s3forcepathstyle: true
    compress: true

table_manager:
  retention_deletes_enabled: true
  retention_period: 2160h  # 90 days
```

- [Loki Storage](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/storage/)
- [Loki Retention](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/storage/retention/)

##### CloudWatch Optimization (AWS-Native)
- **Log Filtering**: Filter out debug logs before ingestion
- **Metric Filters**: Use metric filters instead of log queries
- **Aggregation**: Aggregate logs at application level
- **Retention**: Use CloudWatch Insights for analysis

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# CloudWatch Agent config
{
  "logs": {
    "logs_collected": {
      "files": {
        "collect_list": [
          {
            "file_path": "/var/log/app.log",
            "log_group_name": "/aws/application/app",
            "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}",
            "retention_in_days": 90,
            "multi_line_start_pattern": "^\\[",
            "filters": [
              {
                "type": "exclude",
                "expression": "level=debug"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **90-day retention**: 5GB total → $0.15/month storage + $2.50/month ingestion
- **Compute**: Managed service → $0/month
- **Total**: $2.65/month

**OpenTelemetry + Jaeger**:
- **Storage Strategy**: Trace sampling (10%) + compression
- **90-day retention**: 5GB total → $50-200/month
- **Compute**: 3-5 instances → $150-750/month
- **Total**: $200-950/month
