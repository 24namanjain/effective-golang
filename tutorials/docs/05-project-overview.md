# Project Overview

This document explains the main application project in simple terms. Don't worry if you don't understand everything at first - this is just to give you an overview of what the project does and how it's organized.

## What Does This Project Do?

This project is a **game leaderboard system**. Think of it like a website where:
- People can register and log in
- They can play games and get scores
- Their scores are ranked on leaderboards
- You can see who's the best player

**Real-world examples**: Think of video game leaderboards, sports rankings, or quiz app scores.

## Project Structure (Simplified)

```
effective-golang/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/server/           # The main program that runs the website
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/             # The "brain" of the application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/            # Handles user login/registration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ game/            # Manages games and scores
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leaderboard/     # Handles rankings and leaderboards
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models/          # Defines what data looks like
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/utils/           # Helper tools used throughout the app
â””â”€â”€ tests/               # Tests to make sure everything works
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. Models (What Data Looks Like)

**Think of models like forms or templates**:

```go
// A User is like a profile card
type User struct {
    ID       string    // Unique identifier
    Username string    // Display name
    Email    string    // Contact email
    Password string    // Secret password (hidden)
}

// A Game is like a match record
type Game struct {
    ID        string    // Game identifier
    Player1   string    // First player
    Player2   string    // Second player
    Score1    int       // Player 1's score
    Score2    int       // Player 2's score
    Status    string    // "active", "finished", etc.
}

// A Leaderboard is like a ranking table
type Leaderboard struct {
    ID      string    // Leaderboard name
    Entries []Entry   // List of players and their scores
}
```

### 2. Services (The Business Logic)

**Think of services like departments in a company**:

- **Auth Service**: Handles user accounts (like HR department)
- **Game Service**: Manages games and scores (like sports department)
- **Leaderboard Service**: Handles rankings (like statistics department)

### 3. Handlers (The Reception Desk)

**Think of handlers like receptionists**:
- They receive requests from users
- They call the right service to handle the request
- They send back the response

## How It Works (Step by Step)

### 1. User Registration
```
User fills out form â†’ Handler receives request â†’ Auth Service creates account â†’ Response sent back
```

### 2. Playing a Game
```
User starts game â†’ Handler receives request â†’ Game Service creates game â†’ Response sent back
```

### 3. Updating Scores
```
User submits score â†’ Handler receives request â†’ Game Service updates score â†’ Leaderboard Service updates rankings â†’ Response sent back
```

### 4. Viewing Leaderboard
```
User requests leaderboard â†’ Handler receives request â†’ Leaderboard Service gets rankings â†’ Response sent back
```

## Key Features

### 1. User Management
- **Registration**: Users can create accounts
- **Login**: Users can sign in
- **Profiles**: Users have personal information

### 2. Game Management
- **Create Games**: Start new games between players
- **Track Scores**: Record scores during games
- **Game Status**: Track if games are active or finished

### 3. Leaderboard System
- **Real-time Rankings**: Scores update immediately
- **Multiple Leaderboards**: Different types (weekly, monthly, etc.)
- **User Rankings**: See where each user stands

### 4. Concurrency (Advanced Feature)
- **Multiple Users**: Many people can use the system at once
- **Background Processing**: Some tasks happen automatically
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes appear instantly

## Technology Used

### 1. Go Language Features
- **Structs**: To organize data
- **Interfaces**: To define contracts between parts
- **Goroutines**: For handling multiple users
- **Channels**: For communication between parts
- **Error Handling**: For dealing with problems

### 2. Web Technologies
- **HTTP**: For communication between client and server
- **JSON**: For data format
- **REST API**: For organizing web requests

### 3. Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access
- **Service Layer**: For business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: For flexible code

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Basics (Start Here)
1. **Read the tutorials**: Start with `getting-started.md`
2. **Run examples**: Try `tutorials/examples/variables.go`
3. **Learn syntax**: Study `go-syntax-basics.md`

### Phase 2: Data Structures
1. **Understand structs**: Read `data-structures.md`
2. **Learn about slices and maps**: Practice with examples
3. **Study interfaces**: Understand how they work

### Phase 3: Error Handling
1. **Read error handling**: Study `error-handling.md`
2. **Practice with examples**: Try writing functions that return errors
3. **Understand best practices**: Learn when and how to handle errors

### Phase 4: Project Study
1. **Look at models**: Examine `internal/models/`
2. **Study services**: Understand `internal/auth/`, `internal/game/`
3. **Read handlers**: See how `cmd/server/handlers.go` works

### Phase 5: Advanced Concepts
1. **Concurrency**: Read `concurrency.md`
2. **Testing**: Study the test files
3. **Architecture**: Understand the overall design

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Go installed on your computer
- Basic understanding of command line

### Steps
1. **Navigate to project**: `cd effective-golang`
2. **Run the server**: `go run cmd/server/*.go`
3. **Access the website**: Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

### What You'll See
- The server will start and show some information
- You can use tools like Postman or curl to test the API
- The server handles requests and sends back responses

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to understand everything?"
**No!** Start with the basics and learn gradually. The project is designed to be studied piece by piece.

### "What if I don't understand a concept?"
That's normal! Programming is learned step by step. Re-read sections, try examples, and don't worry about understanding everything at once.

### "Should I modify the code?"
**Yes!** Experimenting is the best way to learn. Try changing values, adding new features, or breaking things to see what happens.

### "How long will it take to understand everything?"
It depends on your background, but typically:
- **Basics**: 1-2 weeks
- **Data structures**: 2-3 weeks
- **Error handling**: 1-2 weeks
- **Project understanding**: 2-4 weeks
- **Advanced concepts**: Ongoing

## Next Steps

1. **Start with tutorials**: Read `getting-started.md`
