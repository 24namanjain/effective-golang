## 🛠️ Practical Tips

### For Sequential Learning
1. **Don't skip files** - Each builds on the previous
2. **Complete exercises** - Practice what you learn
3. **Take breaks** - Learning takes time
4. **Ask questions** - Don't get stuck on concepts
5. **Review regularly** - Revisit previous concepts

### File Navigation
- **Next file**: Each file links to the next in the sequence
- **Previous file**: Use your browser's back button
- **Index**: Always return to `00-index.md` for overview
- **Examples**: Run `tutorials/examples/` files as you learn

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open [00-index.md](00-index.md)** in your browser
2. **Choose your learning path** based on your experience
3. **Start with the first numbered file** in your chosen path
4. **Read sequentially** through the numbered files
5. **Practice coding** as you go

## 📝 Notes

- **File numbers indicate reading order** - 01, 02, 03, etc.
- **Each file is self-contained** but builds on previous knowledge
- **Cross-references are updated** to use the new numbered names
- **Examples are separate** and can be run independently
- **Project code** is in the main directories, not tutorials
