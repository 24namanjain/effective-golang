## Running Examples

To run the examples:

```bash
# Run variables example
go run tutorials/examples/variables.go

# Run basic usage example
go run tutorials/examples/basic_usage.go
```

## Learning Path

### For Complete Beginners
1. Start with `docs/01-getting-started.md` - Your first Go program
2. Read `docs/02-go-syntax-basics.md` - Learn the fundamentals
3. Study `docs/03-data-structures.md` - Understand how to organize data
4. Practice with examples in `examples/`

### For Those with Some Experience
1. Read `docs/04-error-handling.md` - Learn Go's error handling approach
2. Study `docs/06-core-concepts.md` - Deep dive into Go concepts
3. Read `docs/07-concurrency.md` - Advanced concurrency patterns
4. Examine `docs/05-project-overview.md` - Understand the main application

### For Understanding the Project
1. Read `docs/05-project-overview.md` - High-level overview
2. Study `golang-req.md` - Learning objectives and requirements
3. Examine the actual code in the main project directories

## Note

These are learning materials separate from the main application. The main application code is in the root directory and follows production-ready patterns.
